#Part of Speech Tagging

##Description
Averaged perceptron to perform part-of-speech tagging. Python scripts to train a POS tagging model (postrain.py), and to tag new text (postag.py).

The training program, postrain, should run as follows:

    python3 postrain.py TRAININGFILE MODEL

(Optionally, postrain.py may also accept the option -h DEVFILE, although this is not required.)

where TRAININGFILE is the input file formated with one sentence per line, and each sentence composed of word/tag pairs. 

For example, a small training file might contain these lines:

    This/DT is/VBZ a/DT test/NN ./.
    I/PRP saw/VBD a/DT movie/NN ./.
    I/PRP like/VBP cookies/NNS ./.

and MODELFILE is the output file containing the model.

The postag program should run as follows:

    python3 postag.py MODEL

where MODEL is the model generated by postrain.

postag should take its input from STDIN in the form of one sentence per line, where each sentence is a sequence of words (without tags). Output is written to STDOUT, and will be a tagged sentence (in the same format as the training data) for each input sentence.

Implementation of postag may use percepclassify through a system call, or it may simply read the model and perform the classification without the use of percepclassify.
